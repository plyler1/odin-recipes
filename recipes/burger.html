    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> 
            teaspoon salt</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>

        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
            cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill on high heat and
            lightly oil the grate.
        </li>
        <li>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in
            a medium bowl. Add ground beef and bread
            crumbs and mix with your hands until it's
            well blended. Form into four 3/4-inch-thick-patties.
        </li>
        <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover
            and cook 6-8 minutes, or to desired doneness.
            A thermometer inserted into the patties
            should read at least 160 degrees &#8457;.
